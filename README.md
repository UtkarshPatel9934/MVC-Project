# Utkarsh Sandal's Store

Hey there,

This is my Assignment 1 based on the product called Sandals.

I used MVC ie. Model View Controller approach to build this project.

I created a Database to store Data for my Product with CRUD (CReate, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

I created another two pages for my project called AboutUs and Privacy and modified according to assingned product.

Below is the link to my project in Microsoft Azure Website:
